# Satellite Change Detection with Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning models to detect changes in satellite images over time, using datasets like LEVIR-CD and OSCD.

## Structure
- `src/`: Training scripts, model code, utils
- `notebooks/`: EDA and model experimentation
- `outputs/`: Logs and predictions
- `data/`: (Ignored) Raw datasets

## Status
ðŸš§ In progress
